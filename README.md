    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Subtract a scalar constant from each element in a one-dimensional double-precision complex floating-point ndarray.

<section class="intro">

</section>

<!-- /.intro -->



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import zxsa from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/blas-ext-base-ndarray-zxsa@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### zxsa( arrays )

Subtracts a scalar constant from each element in a one-dimensional double-precision complex floating-point ndarray.

```javascript
import Complex128Vector from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-vector-complex128@esm/index.mjs';
import Complex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-ctor@esm/index.mjs';
import scalar2ndarray from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-from-scalar@esm/index.mjs';

var x = new Complex128Vector( [ -2.0, 1.0, 3.0, -5.0, 4.0, 0.0, -1.0, -3.0 ] );

var alpha = scalar2ndarray( new Complex128( 5.0, 0.0 ), {
    'dtype': 'complex128'
});

zxsa( [ x, alpha ] );
// x => <ndarray>[ <Complex128>[ -7.0, 1.0 ], <Complex128>[ -2.0, -5.0 ], <Complex128>[ -1.0, 0.0 ], <Complex128>[ -6.0, -3.0 ] ]
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing the following ndarrays:

    -   a one-dimensional input ndarray.
    -   a zero-dimensional ndarray containing the scalar constant to subtract.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The input ndarray is modified **in-place** (i.e., the input ndarray is **mutated**).
